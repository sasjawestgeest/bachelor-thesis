# bachelor-thesis Sasja Westgeest

In this repository, all code used for obtaining the results for my bachelor thesis can be found. The repository contains 3 notebooks. 
* ThePhenomizer.ipynb includes all code used for obtaining predictions from the Phenomizer itself. For this, an username and password were requested and obtained. These are omitted in the notebook. 
* Thesis_code_sasja_westgeest.ipynb contains all code used for the patient-to-profile comparison and patient-to-patient comparisons as are described in my thesis report. The data used is not publicly available and thus not included in this repository. For clarity of names, the variables are named differently than in my thesis. The patient-to-profile comparison is referred to as 'method1' in the code and the patient-to-patient comparison is called 'method2'. The distinction between patient-to-one-patient comparison, patient-to-five-patients comparison and patient-to-group comparison is made by naming the methods 'method2a', 'method2b' and 'method2c' respectively.
* Thesis_print_plot.ipynb includes all code that was used to explore the data and plot the found information. Again, the data used is not included.
