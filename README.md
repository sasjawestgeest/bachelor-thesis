# bachelor-thesis Sasja Westgeest

In this repository, all code used for obtaining the results for my bachelor thesis can be found. The repository contains 3 notebooks. 
* ThePhenomizer.ipynb includes all code used for obtaining predictions from the Phenomizer itself. For this, an username and password were requested and obtained. These are omitted in the notebook. 
* Thesis_code_sasja_westgeest.ipynb contains all code used for the patient-to-profile comparison and patient-to-patient comparisons as are described in my thesis report. The data used is not publicly available and thus not included in this repository. 
* Thesis_print_plot.ipynb includes all code that was used to explore the data and plot the found information. Again, the data used is not included.
